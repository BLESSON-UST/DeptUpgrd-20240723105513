The provided file content does not appear to be a Java file. It seems to be a YAML configuration file used in a Spring Cloud application. For the upgrade to Java 17, only Java files need to be considered. Therefore, I cannot provide a modified code for the given content. If you have any Java file that needs to be upgraded, please provide it and I'll be happy to assist you.
