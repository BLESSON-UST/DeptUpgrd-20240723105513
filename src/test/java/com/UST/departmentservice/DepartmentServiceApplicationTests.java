Here is the modified code upgraded to be compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class DepartmentServiceApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
```

No changes were required as the original code is already compatible with Java 17.
